/**
 * Bundle the runtime asset trees into a single JSON blob the compiled binary can
 * embed.
 *
 * `bun build --compile` produces one file, but octomux needs several of these
 * assets to exist as *real files on disk*: Claude Code reads skills from
 * ~/.claude/skills, hook templates get copied into repos, and express.static
 * serves the SPA from a directory. So they ride along as base64 in
 * `server/assets.generated.json` and `server/assets.ts` unpacks them on first
 * run. See `assetRoot()` there.
 *
 * Run as part of `bun run build`, before the compile step.

// neither — the compiled binary shipped zero skills until this was fixed.

// every file relative to `root`, and `enginePresetsDir()` resolves
// `<assetRoot()>/server/harnesses/presets`, so the two line up. Without this entry
// a compiled binary resolves a directory that does not exist and ships zero engine
