# octomux

> **Coding got faster. Managing agents didn't.**

octomux is a **local dashboard for running many Claude Code and Cursor agents in parallel.** Each agent works in its own git worktree; you get **one inbox** for every "allow this tool?" prompt, a **live grid** of the whole fleet, and **in-app diff review**. Runs on your machine — no cloud, no telemetry, MIT.

```bash
npm install -g octomux && octomux init && cd your-repo && octomux start
```

Open **[localhost:7777](http://localhost:7777)**, describe a task, pick **Claude Code** or **Cursor**, and watch it work.

---

## What you get

Four acts, one window — from prompt to merged PR:

- **① Dispatch** — Type a task (or paste a Jira/Linear/GitHub link, or a whole list). Each one gets its own worktree, branch, and agent. Pick the model and the harness per task.
- **② Run unattended** — Attach a verify command and the agent **loops in fresh context until that command exits 0**. Put it on a **cron** and it does that at 3am. Hand a goal to the **orchestrator** and it plans, splits, and dispatches child tasks for you to approve.
- **③ Watch, or don't** — Every agent's live terminal on one **Monitor grid**, the diff as it grows, and every "allow this tool?" prompt collected in a single **inbox** instead of scattered across panes.
- **④ Review & ship** — An agent drafts a walkthrough and inline comments grounded on the real diff. You read it in-app, mark files reviewed, send comments back for a fix, and publish as one batched GitHub review when _you_ accept it. octomux spots the PR by branch and closes the task when it merges.

Crash, reboot, close the lid — `octomux start` restores every task, branch, and session.

### The 60-second version

```bash
npm install -g octomux && octomux init
cd your-repo && octomux start          # → localhost:7777

# or skip the UI and loop a task until the tests actually pass:
octomux create-task -t "Fix the flaky checkout test" -d "..." -p "..." -r .
octomux loop-start --task <id> --verify "npm test" --max-iterations 8
```

## Screenshots

Every screenshot is full width — a dashboard shrunk into a table cell is texture, not information.

**Review workstation** — the agent opens with a verdict, a risk read, and a ranked list of things worth looking at, each linked to a line. Start there, then drop into the diff.

![Review walkthrough](assets/screenshots/review-walkthrough.png)

**Monitor grid** — every running agent's terminal on one wall. Spot the stuck one instantly.

![Monitor grid](assets/screenshots/monitor-grid.png)

**Command center** — kanban across the real workflow, backlog → done.

![Command center](assets/screenshots/command-center.png)

<details>
<summary><b>More screens</b> — inbox, schedules, orchestrator, diff review, phone</summary>

**Home inbox + composer** — every "allow this?" in one queue, recent activity, and the dispatch bar.

![Home inbox](assets/screenshots/home-inbox.png)

**Schedules** — cron, timezone, model, verify command and prompt, all editable from the UI.

![Schedules](assets/screenshots/schedules.png)

**Orchestrator** — an agent planning and dispatching child tasks, each awaiting your approval.

![Orchestrator](assets/screenshots/orchestrator.png)

**Diff review** — file tree, reviewed state, inline comments.

</details>

## Features

Each screen is a lens over one managed agent backend:

- **Sessions inbox** — every permission prompt across every agent in one place; reply once, agents keep going. Tab title shows `(N) octomux` when something needs you.
- **Command center** — kanban across the real workflow (backlog → planned → in progress → review → PR → done), with filter-to-attention and a restore grace period on delete.
- **Monitor grid** — every running agent's terminal tiled into one live wall; spot the stuck one instantly.
- **Orchestrator view** — watch an agent that dispatches agents: the parent planning, its children coding, who's blocked — the whole tree at once.
- **Review workstation** — an agent drafts a walkthrough + inline comments (grounded against the real diff, no invented line numbers); nothing hits GitHub until you accept it, then it posts as one batched review. Reject a comment with a reason and it remembers for next time.
- **Chats, Workspaces, persistent agents** — detach a quick spike as its own session, manage the reusable worktrees behind your tasks, and keep long-lived agents (own system prompt, optional Telegram/Slack channel) on **Agents**.
- **Loops** — hand a task a prompt plus a verify command and it re-runs itself in fresh context until verify passes; `/loops` shows the iteration ledger, what each pass changed, and the stop controls. Fan out N competing candidates from one prompt when you want options.
- **Schedules** — run a task on a cron from `/schedules` (nightly triage, a weekly digest) instead of remembering to kick it off.
- **Worktrees keep agents off each other** — five agents can edit `auth.ts` at once without conflicts on your main tree.
- **Run it anywhere** — npm CLI, a **macOS desktop app** ([`.dmg`](https://github.com/ShreyPaharia/octomux/releases)), or hosted on a box and reached from your **phone over Tailscale** (the UI is mobile-ready).
- **Local-only** — no telemetry, no cloud sync. Your `.env` stays on the host.

## Patterns

Three workflows octomux makes one-click:

- **Verifier — two agents, two opinions.** Claude wrote it; drop Cursor on the same branch for a second pass. A different model reads the diff without inheriting the first's assumptions, catching the bugs that pass type-checking but break in prod.
- **Sweep — five PRs by lunch.** Paste a Jira filter or GitHub issue list; each ticket gets its own worktree and agent. Come back from standup to a kanban of ready-to-review PRs.
- **Operator — one prompt becomes an epic.** Give an agent the orchestrator skills; it plans a spec, breaks it into subtasks, and dispatches each into its own worktree. You supervise from the Orchestrator view.

## Why octomux

The editor was built around a human typing one file at a time. That's not the job anymore. The job is directing a fleet — and the hard part moved from _writing_ code to _reviewing_ it, _unblocking_ it, and _knowing what's happening_ across ten sessions.

octomux is a bet on what that surface should look like: not a chat box bolted onto a file tree, but a control deck. It handles the ugly backend of running agents and puts the human's job — the inbox, the fleet grid, the review workstation, the orchestrator — front and center. It's early and opinionated, and the roadmap is shaped in the open.

## Requirements

- macOS (arm64/x64) or Linux for the CLI; macOS for the desktop app
- Node.js 20+ · `git` (`tmux` ships bundled)
- At least one harness: **Claude Code** (`claude`) and/or **Cursor CLI** (`cursor-agent`)

<details>
<summary><b>Remote access from your phone (Tailscale)</b></summary>

octomux binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. To reach it from another device, put them on a
[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) tailnet and start in remote mode:

```bash
octomux start --bind 0.0.0.0     # or: OCTOMUX_BIND=0.0.0.0 octomux start
```

A random access token is generated on first start (path logged to
`~/.octomux/data/remote-token`; override with `OCTOMUX_REMOTE_TOKEN`). Open
`http://<host-magicdns-name>:7777` from a tailnet device and sign in once. Only tailnet
devices can reach the port; the token is a second factor. For HTTPS, front it with
`tailscale serve`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Built to extend</b></summary>

octomux keeps a clean line between the **agent backend** (done for you) and the **views**
(where the value is). Building blocks available today:

- **REST API** (~130 endpoints) over tasks, agents, diffs, reviews, chats, workspaces, skills.
- **Three live WebSocket channels** — `/ws/events` for task/chat/review events, `/ws/terminal/*` for bidirectional xterm ↔ tmux, and `/ws/orchestrator/:convId` for the conductor's conversation stream.
- **A queryable SQLite schema** — tasks, agents, permission prompts, review runs, comments, learnings.
- **User hook scripts** — drop executables in `~/.octomux/hooks/<event>.d/` (or `<repo>/.octomux/hooks/<event>.d/`) to fire on task-lifecycle events.

There still isn't a drop-in API for custom **UI views** — adding one means building against
these blocks in the codebase. For workflows, integration providers, and harnesses, though, see
below: that line moved.

</details>

## Plugins

octomux is a **metaharness** — a third-party npm package can register a **workflow**, an
**integration provider**, or a **harness** without forking octomux. List it in
`~/.octomux/octomux.yml`, export one `apply(ctx)` function, and octomux calls it at boot.

| Registrar                     | Adds                                                             | Example                           |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `ctx.workflows.register()`    | a workflow kind — cron-triggered or run-based, own config schema | a nightly "translate strings" job |
| `ctx.integrations.register()` | a handler for task lifecycle events (issue tracker, chat, CI)    | GitHub Issues instead of Jira     |
| `ctx.harnesses.register()`    | a new coding-agent backend                                       | Aider, Codex CLI, OpenHands       |

The smallest possible plugin — a workflow that logs on every run:

```js
// index.js
export function apply(ctx) {
  ctx.workflows.register({
    kind: 'hello',
    displayName: 'Hello World',
    surfaces: ['session'],
    run: async (runCtx) => {
      ctx.logger.info({ repo: runCtx.repoPath }, 'hello from a plugin');
    },
  });
}
```

Installing one today is manual — there's no `octomux plugins add` yet:

```bash
npm install --prefix ~/.octomux octomux-plugin-hello
```

```yaml
# ~/.octomux/octomux.yml
plugins:
  - id: hello
    name: octomux-plugin-hello # or an absolute path, while developing one locally
    version: 1.0.0
```

Restart octomux. `octomux plugins list` shows what's in the manifest; `octomux doctor` reports
whether each row actually loaded, and how long its `apply()` took.

**[docs/plugins/README.md](./docs/plugins/README.md)** ·
**[API reference](./docs/plugins/api-reference.md)**.

**Security, plainly:** a plugin runs in-process with the DB handle, every stored credential,
and full `process.env` — there is no sandbox and none is planned. Only install a plugin you'd
trust with `npm install`'s postinstall scripts. `octomux start --safe-mode` skips every plugin
row at boot if one goes bad.

## FAQ

**Is this just tmux + git worktrees?** Underneath, largely yes — one tmux session per task, one window per agent, one worktree per branch. `tmux attach -t octomux-agent-<id>` still works and your own scripts still work; nothing is hidden from you. What octomux adds is the layer above: one permission inbox, the whole fleet on one grid, loops with a verify command, cron schedules, and a review workstation. If you have already built that on top of tmux, you do not need this.

**What does it cost to run?** Nothing beyond what you already pay. MIT licensed, and it adds no inference cost of its own — it drives the Claude Code or Cursor subscription you already have. Loops multiply token spend by the iteration count, so set `--max-iterations` and a budget.

**Will an overnight loop burn through my plan limits?** Loops are capped. You set a max iteration count and an optional token/time budget, and a loop stops early when it stops making progress. Every pass and its cost lands in the `/loops` ledger, and you can stop a run from the UI or your phone.

**What if two agents touch the same file?** During the work they can't — each task is its own git worktree on its own branch, so your main working tree never moves. At merge time you still get normal git conflicts; what octomux gives you is all N diffs in one review queue so you pick the merge order deliberately.

**Can I use it from my phone?** Yes — host it on a tailnet box and open the mobile-ready dashboard from any device on the tailnet.

**What if my laptop reboots?** Run `octomux start`; tasks, branches, terminals, and review state come back.
